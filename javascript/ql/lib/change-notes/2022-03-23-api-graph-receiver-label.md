* The following predicates on `API::Node` have been changed so as not to include the receiver. The receiver should now only be accessed via `getReceiver()`.
  - `getParameter(int i)` previously included the receiver when `i = -1`
  - `getAParameter()` previously included the receiver
  - `getLastParameter()` previously included the receiver for calls with no arguments
